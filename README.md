# Clyde
Recreation of Discord's cancelled AI chatbot.

## Information
#### Name
This bot can be named however you like, we don't recommend using `Clyde`, as Discord can strike your bot down for impersonation. Use a unique name.

#### Programming Languages
Clyde uses Python for the AI magic we do on it.

#### AI Models
Clyde uses a selection of over 20 models from Google, Meta, Mistral, DeepSeek and many more, you can pick any one you like.

#### Image Generation
Clyde can now generate images using the Google's Gemini Native Image Generation, provided by [Image Router](https://ir.myqa.cc). Provide it an instruction, and it'll try its best to follow.
